# Helcim, a Payment Processing Hellian


## Overview and Origin 
---
**Company:** Helcim

Helcim was found in 2006 as Helcim Commerce in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The founder is Nicolas Beique, who today serves as the CEO of the company.  

Beique founded this company in his early 20s in his parent's basement, as he saw a need to provide an online digital platform for companies to accept payments outside of the traditional bank channels. 

Initialy, Helcim started as a reseller of merchant services and has since grown to becoming a full-service payment company in 2020. Helcim started out as a bootstrapped company, which means they didn't raise money and grew out of their own funds.  However, most recenlty, the company later secured $16mm in funding to begin expansion in 2022 as discussed below in Business Activities. 


## Business Activities 
---

As previously mentioned, the primary domain is online payments serving an audience of small to medium sized businesses.  

According to their site, their competitive advantage is the ability to provide high quality customer service with no contracts or termination fees. Additionally, they are an all-in-one processor with transparent pricing and no hidden costs. This is a critical complaint in the merchant service business as companies struggle to understand how they are priced and fees associated with taking the numerous various credit/debt cards available for payment processing.    

Furthermore, Helcim can also provide their customers with an online store front, which separates Helcim from other merchants providers. This technology includes front end and back-end customizeable invoicing and multiple APIs availbale to enhance the entire shopping experience. Helcim is able to host their payment processing function on their server and payments will flow directly to the company (via API HelcimPay.js). Moreover, they also provide customizeable invoice creation with their customer's logo to help with e-commerce online point of sale.  

According to Helcim's news release website, the company secured $16 million in funding in 2022, which portions of the funding will be deployed to migrate to Google Cloud services. Some of the cloud services include BigQuery, Vertex AI, GKE, Cloud SQL and Cloud Run. From an API perspective, Helcim can integrate with over 80+ APIs to help businesses effectively use their processing platform. 


## Landscape 
---

Helcim is a B2B payment processor and as previously mentioned, competes in the digital merchant service space. Unlike most merchant providers, Helcim does not resale or outsource their merchant service. Payment processing is completed in-house.

The digital payment industry will continue to expand in correlation with the growing expansion presence of e-Commerce. I would consider the growing emergence of online shopping to be the driving factors to expansion in this industry, as digitalized payments is necessary to operate in an infinite environment of online and mobile shopping services. Morever, companies are also identifying opportunities to begin to accept other forms of currency, such as cryptocurrency, as well simplying the ability to accept international currency and streamlining the FX coversions.  

Competitors: Stripe, PayPal, Square, Elavon, Authorize.net, First Data


## Results 
---
According to Avenue Calgary, the company generates approximately an estimated $48+ million in revenues working with companies in US and Canada and has over 50 employees and still expanding.  Avenue Calgary indicates that the company processes $2.5 billion in online payments and processes for over 6500 businessses. 

Their core metrics it to be an all-in-encompassing online processing platform, including merchant and ACH processing. The company's website indicates that they strive to provide transparent fee information to their customers. According to their website, their mission is to be the "Most Loved Payments Company". 

Outside the scope of merchant processing, but also provides inventory management with integration with accounting software, such as Quickbooks.  

Performance in relation to competitors: Square and Stripe are some of the largest payment and merchant processors. Stripe processes major corporations such as Amazon.  

However, according to Forbes Advisor, Helcium was voted Best Credit Card Processing Companies of 2023, specifically for Fast-Growing Businesses. Forbes provided a 4.3 rating on their website. Investopedia ranks Helcim Best Overall in their category but does rank their competitors Stripe for best for e-Commerce.  


## Recommendations
---
According to the Helcim's website, the product offering includes point of sale terminals (merchant), online payment processing, ACH and International Payments. Additionally, they offer payment and invoice hosting services as well as inventory management/reporting.  

The company could create fraud detection and fraud mitigation services to combat identity theft of stolen cards when bumped up against their database. This would include the typical KYC due diligence on individuals and customers, which would bump up against the RegTech domain. Additionally, another product would be expanding services to review consumer purchasing trends and buyer data analytics to understand both consumer and commercial buying behaviors. 

Potential technologies it could use would be Python, AWS and Blockchain to name a few.
